# NOW - Working Memory (WM)

> This file captures the current focus / sprint.
> It should always describe what we're doing right now.

<!-- SUMMARY_START -->
**Current Focus (auto-maintained by Agent):**
- Align project memory with the Evidence Ledger V1 spec and define near-term build steps.
- Choose baseline tech stack and draft the core data model for SourceItems, Artifacts, Events, Claims, and Assessments.
- Outline the MVP flow: ingestion → capture → processing → reviewer/public UI.
<!-- SUMMARY_END -->

## Current Objective

Translate the V1 spec into an executable MVP plan and initial implementation scaffolding.

---

## Active Branch

- `main`

---

## What We Are Working On Right Now

- [ ] Confirm stack choices (backend language, queue, capture tooling, frontend).
- [ ] Draft DB schema for SourceItem, Artifact, Event, Claim, ClaimAssertion, Assessment, TransparencyLogEntry.
- [ ] Define ingestion inputs (RSS + curated URL lists) and capture tier policy.
- [ ] Sketch UI flows for Calendar, Daily Ledger, Event page, Review Queue.
- [ ] Plan transparency log generation + verification page.

---

## Next Small Deliverables

- Core schema draft and terminology alignment with Spec.md.
- MVP architecture outline and component responsibilities.
- UI wire-level flow for daily review + event pages.

---

## Drift Guards (keep NOW fresh)

- Keep NOW to 5–12 active tasks; remove completed items.
- Refresh summary blocks every session.
- Move stable decisions into PROJECT_CONTEXT.

---

## Notes / Scratchpad

- If NOW grows, move details into SESSION_NOTES and roll up key points.
