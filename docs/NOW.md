# NOW - Working Memory (WM)

> This file captures the **current focus / sprint**.  
> It should always describe what we're doing *right now*.

<!-- SUMMARY_START -->
**Current Focus (auto-maintained by Agent):**
- Polish the docs so the workflow is unmistakable.
- Build an end-to-end example project walkthrough.
- Trial the kit against one real codebase.
<!-- SUMMARY_END -->

## Current Objective

Deliver a polished local-mcp-context-kit template that includes example usage and has been validated on a real repo.

---

## Active Branch

- `main`

---

## What We Are Working On Right Now

- [ ] Tighten and proofread all docs (PROJECT_CONTEXT, NOW, SESSION_NOTES, supporting guides).
- [ ] Create an example project walkthrough showing how agents update the memory files.
- [ ] Run the workflow on a real codebase to confirm the process is solid.

---

## Next Small Deliverables

- Updated docs folder with polished guidance and screenshots if needed.
- Checked-in example project or scenario illustrating usage.
- Report/findings from testing the kit on a live repo.

---

## Notes / Scratchpad

- Blocked on gathering any additional stakeholder requirements before publishing widely.
